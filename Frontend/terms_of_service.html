Data is offered as gigabytes and your usage of data is calculated as follows: each kilobyte (kb) used is rounded to the nearest full megabyte (mb) and billed to your account in increments of 1,000 megabytes per gigabyte. Faith Wireless may contact you as your usage approaches your chosen Monthly Service Plan&rsquo;s data usage limit, in order to offer you additional options to continue using data. These options include, but are not limited to, increasing your Monthly Service Plan, renewing your current Monthly Service Plan early, or continuing to use your other billed services without continued data usage for the remainder of your billing cycle.

All information and content provided or shown via the Service is protected and proprietary.

You agree to immediately provide us any and all updated information relevant to you and your account.

You further consent to us sharing that data with third parties.</li>
                    <li><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>. You recognize that the Service is the proprietary and confidential property of the Company. Accordingly, you shall not, without the prior express written consent of the Company, disclose or reveal to any third party or utilize for your own benefit other than pursuant to this Agreement, any confidential information provided by us or obtained by you concerning the Service, trade secrets, specifications or other proprietary information provided that such information was not previously known to you or disclosed to the general public.

                    <li><strong>NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP</strong>. Your use of the Service does not create any type of Company duty or responsibility to you or to any other persons or entities. This Agreement does not create a joint venture, partnership, or employee-employer relationship. The parties have no rights as to each other than those set forth in this Agreement and any which are inalienable by law.</li>
                    <li><strong>DISPUTES</strong>. If you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. You agree to give us the opportunity to resolve any disputes relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Service, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;) by contacting Faith Wireless Customer Support at contact us form. You must provide a written description of the problem and a statement of the specific relief sought. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 30 days, you may seek relief through arbitration as set forth below.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS RIGHTS THAT YOU MAY OTHERWISE HAVE. IT PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS (INCLUDING ONES THAT ALREADY ARE THE SUBJECT OF LITIGATION) THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT IN THE EVENT THAT THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE OR CLAIM. ARBITRATION IS BINDING AND SUBJECT TO ONLY A VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF FAITH WIRELESS&rsquo; AGREEMENT WITH YOU. YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS NO JUDGE NOR JURY IN ARBITRATION BUT THAT AN ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO RECOVER IN A COURT OF LAW. YOU AND FAITH WIRELESS FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MUST HONOR THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EITHER PARTY MAY BRING A CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT.</p>
                    <p>Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court / by use of the formal legal system. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms required arbitration. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis much of the same damages and relief as a court.</p>
                    <p>Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules, unless otherwise stipulated by you and by us. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. You and Faith Wireless agree that this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to Faith Wireless, LLC at 1307 Hodges Street, Raleigh, NC 27604. If we invoke arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. A party requesting arbitration must also provide a copy of the request to the AAA online at www.adr.org or at any AAA office.</p>
                    <p>Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. Further, unless both you and Faith Wireless expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If the preclusion of class or representative proceedings is found to be unenforceable, then this entire arbitration clause shall be null and void. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><strong>NO THIRD PARTY OR NON-PARTY RIGHTS</strong>. Neither this Agreement or your use of the Service creates any rights for third parties or non-parties.</li>
